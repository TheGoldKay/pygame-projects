Goal: Make a copy of this game -> https://torcado.itch.io/windowkill 

1 - Learn how to mess around with python ctypes -> https://realpython.com/python-ctypes/
1.1 - Manipulating the game's window directly through `ctypes.windll` (windows exclusive)

* The script allows the screen's enclosing -> Create an entity/agent to resize the screen as it moves.

-> Make window transparent and without borders (no frame) 
-> Draw a circle (big enough to touch all borders) in the center of the screen

* There is no need to reduce the window through ctypes.windll, you can just make it transparent and without borders.
* The screen not being perceived by the player is all that matters and setting it to invisible is much better than manipulating it directly with pythong's ctypes 
* Once invisible, you can create either use a circular or rectangular shape and enclose it instead.
