the game's window will be constantly closing in from all sides 
if the player shots at the window's wall the wall will move back for as long it's being fired upon 
there will be enemies coming from the player from also all sides 
the player dies if either the walls touch it or the enemies 
the player will move by WASD and the bullets will be fired in the direction the mouser pointer is towards 
click the left button to fire 
possible special ability: pess right mouse button to create a circle around the player (breathing time / kill enemies)

Goal: Make a copy of this game -> https://torcado.itch.io/windowkill 

1 - Learn how to mess around with python ctypes -> https://realpython.com/python-ctypes/
1.1 - Manipulating the game's window directly through `ctypes.windll` (windows exclusive)

* The script allows the screen's enclosing -> Create an entity/agent to resize the screen as it moves.

-> Make window transparent and without borders (no frame) 
-> Draw a circle (big enough to touch all borders) in the center of the screen

* There is no need to reduce the window through ctypes.windll, you can just make it transparent and without borders.
* The screen not being perceived by the player is all that matters and setting it to invisible is much better than manipulating it directly with pythong's ctypes 
* Once invisible, you can create either use a circular or rectangular shape and enclose it instead.

* The main display will be set to fullscreen
* The display will be filled with rectangles, each of them to be treated as a display
* To the player they will be seem as seperate entities, but they're just surfaces drawn upon a transparent display (another surface)
* Must find a way to store these rects (displays) positions in releation to the transparent main display to allow proper 
iteration among them and also the player character
* A possible future iteration is one enemy from one display fire and the bullet seemingly teleport from its display to the player's
display current display (where they are), the player will also be able to do the same (but will be unable to leave their own display)
